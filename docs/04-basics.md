```python 
def sum(x, y):
    return x+y
```

This is a function. We use the keyword "def" to start off the function, followed by the name of the function (in this case, "sum"). 
Within the brackets, we specify the parameters or inputs to the function. We use the keyword "return" to specify the outputs of the function.

To use a function, or perform what we call a function call, we could write:

```python
a = sum(3,4)
```

This assigns the value of sum(3,4), which is 7, to the variable a. 

Unlike in maths, however, functions in python do not need to have inputs and outputs. So, this is also a valid function:

```python
def sayhi():
    print("hi")
```

Functions are an important tool that allows us to organise our code and package sets of instructions which perform a specific task. 
Once we have defined a function, we will be able to use it in multiple places. We can also use functions that other people have written in our code.
