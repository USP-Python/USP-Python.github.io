## Creating a Bot Account
First, we need to have a telegram account (bot) to access. Talk to [@Botfather](https://t.me/botfather), a telegram bot by telegram to create telegram bots, to create a bot.

You will also need to know your own telegram user ID, so the bot knows who to send messages to. Talk to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get this information.
