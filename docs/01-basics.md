# Data Types, Operations, and Variables

One way to understand programming is as a process of _transforming_ data. A simple calculator performing addition is programmed, for example, to transform two numbers into one.

It is therefore necessary to consider,

1. Types of data
2. Operations on data
3. Naming of data

## Data Types

There are many built-in data types in python[^1]. For now, we need only focus on the following,

* Integers (`int`)
* Strings (`str`)
* Booleans (`bool`)

[^1]: For the curious, see the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html).
