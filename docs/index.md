# Set-Up
Welcome to an _Introduction to Python with Telegram Bots_. To begin, we must first set up the [python programming language](https://www.python.org/)[^1][^2] and the [python-telegram-bot library](https://python-telegram-bot.org/). **Please complete these installation before the workshop.**

Instructions for Windows and macOS operating systems follow[^3]. If you run into any problems, you may contact through telegram:

## Windows

1. Download and install python3
2. Download and install python-telegram-bot

## macOS

1. Download and install python3
2. Download and install python-telegram-bot

[^1]: To be more precise, this is the CPython _interpreter_ for the python programming language. This tells the computer how to 'make sense' of python code.
[^2]: We are using Python 3, which is a version of python. Make sure that you're not getting Python 2!
[^3]: If you're able to run an OS that is not Windows or macOS (_ABSOLUTELY PROPRIETARY_), then I assume you can handle the installation by yourself.
